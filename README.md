# CI-GA-ACO
Computational Intelligence - Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization

During this project, I had the chance to work with three colleagues and tackle two well-known problems by creating our own AI models. 
The first part involved solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Genetic Algorithm. 
In the second part, we focused on finding paths in mazes using the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm. 
Specifically, we trained a robot to navigate through mazes and find the fastest route between a given starting and ending point. 
We implemented the entire project using Python.
